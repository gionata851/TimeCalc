### Calculator for time measures

Welcome to my time calculator! Visit it at: https://gionata851.github.io/TimeCalc/

How to use:
1. feel free to use the keyboard.
2. normal operations without time measures are allowed.
3. in order to use time measures start creating the first operator inserting a numer. For example 3:

**you'll get:**
```
    3
```

and then add the unit measure by selecting hours, minutes or seconds. For example hours:

**you'll get:**
```
    3 hours
```

you can add another measure in the same operator, for example in this case you can add 45 and then minutes:

**you'll get:**
```
     3 hours 45 minutes
```

4. now you can select the operation, for example "+"

**you'll get:**
```
     3 hours 45 minutes + 
```

5. then add the second operator in the same way. For example pressing 1 -> hours -> 30 -> minutes

**you'll get:**
```
     3 hours 45 minutes + 1 hours 30 minutes
```

6. press enter (or equals in the calc) and you'll get the result.

**you'll get:**
```
     5 hours 15 minutes
```

7. now you can directly pressing another operations and go on. For example "-".

**you'll get:**
```
     5 hours 15 minutes - 
```

8. 4 -> minutes -> 30 -> seconds.

**you'll get:**
```
     5 hours 15 minutes - 4 minutes 30 seconds
```

9. enter (or equals) again for the result.

**you'll get:**
```
     5 hours 10 minutes 30 seconds
```

10. You can also write 1,5 hours and press enter, you'll get the time in integers measures:

**you'll get:**
```
     1 hours 30 minutes
```

11. Or for example: 90 -> minutes -> [enter].

**you'll get:**
```
     1 hours 30 minutes
```

12. If you need a time multiplication or a division, write first an operator with time measures and a non-time second operator. 

For example: 30 -> minutes -> * -> 3 -> [enter]

**you'll get:**
```
     1 hours 30 minutes
```

The section "History" helps you keeping track of all your calculations.

Feel free to mess around and let me know if you find any kind of issue.
